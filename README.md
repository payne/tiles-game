Implementing the Sliding Tiles Puzzle in JavaScript - here's what I mean: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle

# Fun!
I'm delighted to find this (thanks google & github search).   

For now (2/6/16) I have a copy running at http://mattpayne.org/p/

2/10/16 add a gh-pages branch, so it's now at http://payne.github.io/tiles-game/

My hope is to build on fay-jai's work to build a sliding puzzle game that works on my Wife's iPhone.

## TODO:
1. Build a matching puzzle like http://mypuzzle.org/find-the-pair
2. Build a word search puzzle like http://mypuzzle.org/wordsearch
3. Word bubbles
4. 1010! with touch then touch instead of drag and drop.  (maybe drag and drop later).
